## Organization

The VancouVert repository uses a GitFlow workflow; details can be found below for this process.  As of release 1.0 VancouVert is reliant on BootStrap 5, JQuery, and Cloud FireStore, but no extra installation is needed to utilize these tools as they are already sourced within the repository.  Working up to release 1.0, our team primarily used VS Code to develop the project,
but as the project currently only uses HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, any IDE that can handle these languages is acceptable for further development moving forward.

The repository is organized primarily through 4 different folders: 
* the **img** folder stores images
* the **html** folder stores all .html files
* the **css** folder stores all styling 
* the **scripts** folder stores all JavaScript files. 

The root folder also contains various files related to the deployment of the app onto Firestore (firebase.json, .firebaserc, etcâ€¦), as well as a .side file used for testing.  Lastly, the current test plan for the app can be found here:
